## Motivation:

Millions of news articles are published every day. Thousands of them are on a single topic (say of NASAâ€™s rover reaching mars). But the best and most informative articles are never from a single news agency or individual bloggers.  We want to create a News feed and Digest Website with the following tentative features:-
### 1)NEWS SUMMARY :- 
	a)News articles for every topics from a vast amount of sources will be put into a summarizer (based on text mining) so that it can generate summaries .
	b)People can read the summary and click on Expand to read more from the same source.
### 2)NEWS RANKING
	a)Upvotes and Downvotes would be used to rate the quality of content.
	b) Comments and discussions on news could be done below the articles.
### 3)PERSONALIZED NEWS :-  
a) People will make accounts on the site and follow topics of their interest. They will get the highest ranked news from their topics of interest (or authors of interest) in the digest (daily/weekly e-mail). This will be their personal summarized newspaper.
### 4)INCENTIVE SYSTEM:-
	a)People who get more upvotes /views on their personal blogs will get incentives in form of points which will motivate content creators to contribute and get famous through our platform.
	b)This will enhance the credibility of their work.
### 5)CREDIBILITY SYSTEM :-
	a)Articles from reputed authors, international newspapers and  highly credible users will be ranked above others.
	b)The summarizer will take content only from the best text (using ranking of article and reputation of sources) .
	c)Source/Authors of articles will be mentioned near the title.
	d)The articles could be reviewed by content editors before publishing.

Made an application using Swings in Java to fetch news in the form of summaries from news agencies around the world. The news items are categorized based on topics and the user can signup for an account which will give him access to personalized news based on his preference.
